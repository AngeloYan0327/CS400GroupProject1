Today is a perfect day, Angelo wakes up and thinks it is the perfect time to work on the 400 project.

Suddenly, the sky turns dark and the lights are gone. His first thought is that it must be a solar flare, but then
from throughout the black sky, a large UFO appears. Angelo has always been a huge alien fanatic so he gets mixed
emotions of fear and excitement. The UFO slowly gets larger and larger in the sky as it comes closer to the surface.
Angelo is already out in the street along with all of his neighbors. People are starting to panic as the UFO gets closer to the surface.
